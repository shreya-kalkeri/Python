Exercise 1: (10 Points)
City Council for City 'X' has decided to test recovered patients of COVID-19 so that it can safely confirm that
patients cured of the virus are not getting infected again. Given the huge number of tests City 'X' needs to do
on all its inhabitants, the council has decided not to test all recovered patients but instead choose 1 random
recovered patients in every recovered patient 5 . The list of the recovered patients is as below and can grow in
future. 

The below list can be hard coded in your program:
['p1','p2','p3','p4','p5','p6','p7','p8','p9','p10','p11','p12','p13','p14','p15',
'p16','p17','p18','p19','p20']

The batch size of 5 can change depending on whether City 'X' wants to do more or less testing. Before
choosing the next patient, City 'X' also needs to record the test date as its an important parameter to know
when the patient was tested. Only print the test date in your program
Write an object-oriented python program that helps City 'X' choose recovered patients for testing.
Keep in mind about performance and memory consumption as number of recovered patients can be in
millions.

Hint
#Generate a random number
import random
# generate a random number between 0 and 100 : inclusive of 0 and 100
random_number = random.randint(0,100)
